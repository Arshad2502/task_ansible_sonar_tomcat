Design and implement an end-to-end automation for a Java-based web application project where the source code is hosted in GitHub. The project builds into a WAR file using Maven. The CI/CD pipeline should be automated with Jenkins, and you must ensure code quality checks using SonarQube. Once the WAR is built and passes quality gates, it should be deployed to a Tomcat server using Ansible.
